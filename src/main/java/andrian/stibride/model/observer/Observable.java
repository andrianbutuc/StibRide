/**
 * /**
 * This class represents an observable object, or "data" in the model-view
 * paradigm. It can be subclassed to represent an object that the application
 * wants to have observed.
 * <p>
 * An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer may be any
 * object that implements interface {@code Observer}. After an observable
 * instance changes, an application calling the {@code Observable}'s
 * {@code notifyObservers} method causes all of its observers to be notified of
 * the change by a call to their {@code update} method.
 * <p>
 * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified. The
 * default implementation provided in the Observable class will notify Observers
 * in the order in which they registered interest, but subclasses may change
 * this order, use no guaranteed order, deliver notifications on separate
 * threads, or may guarantee that their subclass follows this order, as they
 * choose.
 * <p>
 * Note that this notification mechanism has nothing to do with threads and is
 * completely separate from the {@code wait} and {@code notify} mechanism of
 * class {@code Object}.
 * <p>
 * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is empty.
 * Two observers are considered the same if and only if the {@code equals}
 * method returns true for them.
